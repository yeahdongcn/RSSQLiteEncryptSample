=====================

This Repo demonstrated HOW to encrypt a sqlite db using sqlcipher https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher

Use setKey to set the password for the encrypted db and reKey to change the password in FMDB.

I also had a blog for this: http://yeahdongcn.github.io/posts/encrypt-an-sqlite-db.html
